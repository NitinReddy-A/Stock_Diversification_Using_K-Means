# Portfolio_Diversification:

This project uses K-Means Clustering algorithm to divide the given set of stocks (unlabeled data) into labeled clusters. This project aims to diversify the stocks based on their volatility and return percentages to deliver the most optimised portfolio to the user.
This invovles using the Elbow Method to determine the number of required clusters and then grouping the stocks into the obtained number of clusters.
This project is a very simplified implimentation of Stock diversification and only takes the stock prices into account.
